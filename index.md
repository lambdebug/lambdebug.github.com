title: Lambdebug, clojure step by step, back and forth
---
# Introduction

Hi, my name is Lambdebug.  I can show you how a Clojure program is
executed step by step.  With a little trick I've learned from
Einstein, I can even travel back in time, and show you the steps
backwards.

It's easy to meet me.  Ask Mr Leiningen to get me from clojars.
Then just say these sentences to the REPL,

<div class='repl'><pre><code>
=> (use 'lambdebug)
=> (debug '(+ 1 2))
</code></pre></div>

And voil√°, you're right in the middle of my world.

<div class='repl'><pre><code>
Function: Given at REPL
Form: "<span class='hl'>(+ 1 2)</span>"
>>>
</code></pre></div>

Note the highlight.
You can step into this complicated expression typing `i`, and learn that `+` is
actually `clojure.core/+`, and `(+ 1 2)` equals to `3`.

<div class='repl'><pre><code>
Function: Given at REPL
Form: "<span class='hl'>(+ 1 2)</span>"
>>> i

Function: Given at REPL
Form: ("<span class='hl'>+</span>" 1 2)
Result: #'clojure.core/+
>>>
</code></pre></div>

I can do more sophisticated things.  Try a bit contrived example,

<div class='repl'><pre><code>
=> (debug
      '((fn [x]
          (let [y (dec x)]
            (try
              (+ (/ 1 y) 5)
              (catch ArithmeticException e (inc x)))))
        10))
</code></pre></div>

There are more things to notice here.  When stepping into it,
you'll get the result of `(dec x)` within the let expression, then the
value of `(+ (/ 1 y) 5)`.  If, however, you try `1` instead of `10`, you won't get
to adding `5`, but you land in the catch block, evaluating `(inc x)`.

I can see that you are not quite happy yet.  You have written some nifty
functions.
{% highlight clojure %}
(ns nifty)

(defn count-both
  [x y]
  (+ (count x) (count y)))

(defn duplicate
  [x]
  (if (seq? x)
    (concat x x)
    [x x]))
{% endhighlight %}
No problem, I will follow you into any function defined in a file (with
the exception of the `clojure` namespace),

<div class='repl'><pre><code>
=> (use 'nifty)
=> (debug '(count-both [42] (duplicate [42])))
</code></pre></div>

# I am not perfect

My limitations are,
 * I don't understand type hints.
 * I respect privacy and I don't mess with private functions.
 * Did I say I hate feeling dizzy?  No `loop`, no `recur`.
 * I am OK with most common macros, but not with trickier ones, like `binding`, `->`, `->>`.
 * I am quite picky about java interop.  I like simpler cases with dot
  notation, but no `proxy`, `doto`, etc, please.

*... soon to become a fancier site*

*... download url also available as soon as the code gets mature enough*
