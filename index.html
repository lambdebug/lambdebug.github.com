title: Lambdebug, clojure step by step, back and forth
---
<p>Hi, my name is Lambdebug.  I can show you how a Clojure program is
executed step by step.  With a little trick I've learned from
Einstein, I can even travel back in time, and show you the steps
backwards.</p>
<p>It's easy to meet me.  Just say these sentences to the REPL,
{% highlight clojure %}
(use 'lambdebug)
(debug '(str "Hello," "Lambdebug"))
{% endhighlight %}

<p><i>... soon to become a fancier site</i></p>
