# Introduction

These are random thoughts about why I find exceptions an annoying,
mostly harmless and useless way to solve problems it's trying to solve.
I want to give you a typical example first and explore it later on.
{% highlight java %}
public interface PropertyStore {
  boolean isAvailable();
  String getProperty(String key) throws PropertyException;
}

public class FilePropertyStore implements PropertyStore {

  public String getProperty(String key) throws PropertyException {
    try {
      // Read it from a file
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      throw new PropertyException("Cannot get key " + key, e);
    }
  }
}

public String getFavoriteColor() {
  String color = "pink";
  try {
    color = propertyStore.getProperty("favorite.color");
  }
  catch (PropertyException pe) {
    logger.error("Problem with favorite color ", pe);
  }
  return color;
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Exceptions are not about error handling

Well, exceptions are one of more constructs for error handling.
The code above suggests it's an error not to be able to get my favorite
color, and it smoothly handles it.  But there more approaches.
{% highlight java %}
public String getFavoriteColorUsingDefault() {
  String color = propertyStore.getProperty("favorite.color");
  if (color == null)
    color = "pink";
  return color;
}

public String getFavoriteColorCheckingAvailability() {
  String color = "pink";
  if (propertyStore.isAvailable())
    color = propertyStore.getProperty("favorite.color");
  return color;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Would you say null values and conditionals are for error handling?

# Beaten by averages

Do you want your colleagues to check you every half an hour, asking if
you are sure about the piece of code you are just writing?  I bet you
would kill them the second day.  You want to concentrate on your work
and not get distracted.  And you still get distracted without noticing
it by exceptions.

Suppose, I am working on an important part of the code that calculates
of the average word length in each line of a file.  My first, na√Øve
attempt,
{% highlight java %}
public List<Float> averageOfLines(List<String> lines) {
  List<Float> averages = new ArrayList<Float>();
  for (String line: lines) {
    String[] words = line.split();
    averages.add(averageWordLength(words));
  }
  return averages;
}

public float averageWordLength(String[] words) {
  float total = 0;
  for (String word: words) {
    total += word.size();
  }
  return total / words.length;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I try it on a file, and bang!  An exception is thrown, complaining about
division by zero.  It's actually not easy to access that file manually,
because we are using JEFF, the Java Enterprise File-management Framework.
Anyway, I don't want to throw such an uninformative exception, so I
handle it correctly.
{% highlight java %}
public float averageWordLength(String[] words) {
  float total = 0;
  for (String word: words) {
    total += word.size();
  }
  try {
    return total / words.length;
  }
  catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Well, it can mean more things
    if (words.length == 0) {
      throw new WordlessException();
    }
    else {
      throw e;
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

I am feeling better now.  My code is more robust, my productivity is
high, I just doubled the lines of code in no time.  It just doesn't
compile.  Oops, I have to declare that `averageWordLength` can throw
`WordlessException`.  Good.  Oh, no, it doesn't compile.  Let's shut the
compiler up and declare that `averageOfLines` can also throw
`WordlessException`.

It compiles, it runs -- and bang again.  It's that `WordlessException`
now, and I still don't know which line caused the problem, and I still
don't have my averages.  Here is the final, professional version.
{% highlight java %}
public List<Float> averageOfLines(List<String> lines) {
  List<Float> averages = new ArrayList<Float>();
  for (String line: lines) {
    String[] words = line.split();
    try {
      averages.add(averageWordLength(words));
    }
    catch (WordlessException we) {
      logger.warn("Empty line encountered");
      averages.add(null);
    }
  }
  return averages;
}
{% endhighlight %}


Exceptions are similar to setters-getters. They conform to some
unjustified idea of safety, and they can come very handy.  But they do
nothing most of the time.  If you look into a catch block, you'll
probably find no meaningful code there, but only throwing another
exception, maybe logging something first.  Don't get me wrong, throwing
an exception does convey information.  This mechanism is just a stupid
way to do that.  What does `throw new FooException("oops " + bar)` say?
 - I had an assumption and it turned out to be wrong
 - This assumption can be categorized as `Foo`
 - This assumption is related to `bar` in my context
 - I am helpless, I don't know what to do if this assumption is wrong
 - I want immediate attention.  If you try to ignore me, I'll cry
